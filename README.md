> A Squarespace template scaffold.



### Getting Started

Install the Squarespace dev sever by running `npm install -g @squarespace/server`.

Next, download this template and install the packages with `npm install`. To run the project use `npm start`. This boots the Squarespace server on port `9000`. When you first start the server you will be prompted to create a new Squarespace site. This will get you started. If you change the built-in domain for your site on Squarespace later make sure to update the `.npmrc` file that gets generated once your site is created. This contains the url so the Squarespace module can connect to your site. Use `npm run deploy` to push to your Squarespace site.


#### Notes

This template is a customization of the Squarespace [base-template-npm](https://github.com/Squarespace/base-template-npm).
